##  SQL Change Data Capture Implementation

I discussed more about this project on my meduim article - (https://medium.com/@chiegbuugochukwu/implementing-change-data-capture-in-sql-for-efficient-data-synchronization-8b8325570dee)

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a data engineering technique that identifies and captures changes (inserts, updates, deletes) 
in a database. Itâ€™s essential for keeping systems in sync efficiently without reloading entire datasets.

## Project Overview
This project implements an SQL-based CDC process to synchronize data between a staging table (e.g., stg_student_engagement) and a target table (e.g., target_table). It detects changes, applies them, logs operations, and cleans up for the next load.
## Goals 

1:Identify Changes: Determine which records have been inserted, updated, or deleted between a staging (stg_student_engagement) and a target (target_table) table.

2:  Efficient Data Sync: Minimize data transfer by only processing changes, which is essential for performance in large datasets.

3: Insert New Records: Add new entries from the staging table to the target table.

4:  Update Changed Records: Modify records in the target table where changes have occurred.

5: Delete Obsolete Records: Remove records from the target table that no longer exist in the staging table.


6: Track Changes: Log the number of inserts, updates, and deletions for each run, helping in auditing and ensuring data integrity.

7:  Prepare for Next Run: Clear the staging table to make room for new data imports, ensuring the process can repeat without old data interference.

## How It Works

1:Identify Changes: Compare staging and target tables to flag records as inserts, updates, or deletes.
2: Apply Changes:
Insert new records into the target table.
Update modified records.
Delete obsolete records.


3:Log Changes: Record operations in a control table.
4:Clean Up: Clear the staging table.

## Implementation Details
The core is an SQL script (cdc_script.sql) that:

-Creates a temporary cdc_table to stage changes with an Operation_flag.
-Inserts new records into the target table.
-Deletes outdated records.
-Updates modified records.
-Logs operations in a control table.
-Truncates the staging table.

## View the SQL script

Usage

1: Ensure database access to the staging and target tables.
2: Adjust table names in the script if necessary.
3: Execute the script in your SQL environment.

Challenges and Solutions

.Challenge: Identifying unique records.
.Solution: Combined id and specialization for a composite key.


Challenge: Detecting changes accurately.
Solution: Used EXCEPT DISTINCT for precise comparisons.



Future Improvements

Implement log-based CDC for real-time updates.
Add error handling and transactions for robustness.
